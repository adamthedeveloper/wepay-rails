      # so when this method is called. The following list of key values are pulled
      # in for you from your wepay.yml file:
      #
      # Note: @wepay_config is your wepay.yml as a Hash
      # :callback_uri     => @wepay_config[:ipn_callback_uri],
      # :redirect_uri     => @wepay_config[:checkout_redirect_uri],

      # :type             => @wepay_config[:checkout_type],
      # :charge_tax       => @wepay_config[:charge_tax] ? 1 : 0,
      # :app_fee          => @wepay_config[:app_fee],
      # :auto_capture     => @wepay_config[:auto_capture] ? 1 : 0,
      # :require_shipping => @wepay_config[:require_shipping] ? 1 : 0,
      # :shipping_fee     => @wepay_config[:shipping_fee],
      # :charge_tax       => @wepay_config[:charge_tax],
      # :account_id       => wepay_user['account_id'] # wepay-rails goes and gets this for you, but you can override it if you want to.
